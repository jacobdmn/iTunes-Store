# Honestly, Initially The website was just a simple assignment from Schwarzthal in an interview, but I started liking it more, I'm looking to uodate it, and use:
## - `API` from multipe websites
## - `Redux` to be well organized
## - `Firebase` to make a database for users
## - `TypeScript` to make the code a lot more professional
## - `Affiliate links` from API companies so I can make a profit
...
# PS: in the beginning, probably you need to allow the browser to receive data from API, just by clicking 'CLICK HERE TO ALLOW RESULTS', [just a quick solution for cors block]
